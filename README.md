# C++ Algorithms

This will be a collection of solutions to some problems that I've either encountered in my daily programming
Or the problems that I've solved on coding webistes providing challenges.

Some functions will differ from others in style of coding. 
Some problems will be tackled from a different perspective. They are all suseptable to change.
However, rather than changing the existing solution, an alternate solution will be provided
The comments above the method declaration will state the problem that the method is solving.
